With the sample data provided after the analysis on colab we have found only 1.89% of the contacts are likely to persue an enrollment. And 88.37% of that 1.89% people are likely to start a program. Though most of the leads are from unknown sources they are gradually increasing compared to the previous years. On the other hand, the enrollments and the starts ratio is decreasing year after year.

For part-b we see a great improvement compared to that of part-a. 74.14% of the enrollments are coming from Applications and ISIR Applications. Among them 75.43% started at least a program. Yet the enrollments and starts rates are following negative trends. Likewise the graduation rate is decreasing and withdrawal rate is increasing.
